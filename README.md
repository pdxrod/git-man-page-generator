git-man-page-generator
======================

The Git Man Page parody from https://github.com/Lokaltog/git-man-page-generator, with some minor changes to make it look a bit more like the real thing (eg. it no longer says 'some pre-forwarded tips', but rather 'all post-prepended pre-forwarded ref tip commits'). Turned into a Rails app.
